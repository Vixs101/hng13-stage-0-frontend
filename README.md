That's a fantastic task\! A great README will guide users and reviewers, demonstrating your understanding of the requirements and how you addressed them.

Here is the perfect README in markdown format for your Profile Card project:

# 👤 Profile Card Component (Stage 0 Task)

This project is a small, accessible, and responsive **Profile Card component** built using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It fulfills all the core requirements and acceptance criteria for the Stage 0 task, focusing on semantic markup, modern frontend patterns, and robust testability.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Accessible Markup:** Utilizes semantic HTML tags (`<article>`, `<figure>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.) to ensure a clear document outline and enhanced accessibility.
* **Fully Responsive Layout:** Implements a mobile-first design using **Flexbox** or **Grid** to ensure the card displays correctly across all common breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* **Real-time Clock:** Displays the current time in milliseconds, updated accurately using JavaScript's `Date.now()`.
* **Test-Driven Ready:** Every required visible element includes the specified `data-testid` attribute, enabling stable and reliable automated testing.
* **Best Practices:** Social links are configured to open in a new tab with the required `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes.

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements & Implementation

### HTML & Accessibility

| Content Element | Required `data-testid` | Semantic Tag Suggestion | Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Profile Card Container | `data-testid="test-profile-card"` | `<article>` | The main wrapper for the component. |
| Name | `data-testid="test-user-name"` | `<h2>` or similar | Plain text for the user's name. |
| Short Biography | `data-testid="test-user-bio"` | `<p>` | Paragraph containing the user's bio. |
| Current Time (ms) | `data-testid="test-user-time"` | `<span>` or `<time>` | Updated via `script.js` with `Date.now()`. |
| Avatar Image | `data-testid="test-user-avatar"` | `<img>` inside `<figure>` | Includes an appropriate `alt` attribute. |
| Social Links List | `data-testid="test-user-social-links"` | `<nav>` or `<ul>` | Contains all individual social links. |
| Hobbies List | `data-testid="test-user-hobbies"` | `<ul>` inside `<section>` | Distinct list of hobbies. |
| Dislikes List | `data-testid="test-user-dislikes"` | `<ul>` inside `<section>` | Distinct list of dislikes. |

* **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements (links) are keyboard-focusable with clearly visible focus styles.
* **Image Alt Text:** The avatar image includes a descriptive `alt` attribute for screen readers.

### Styling & Responsiveness

* **Layout:** Implemented using **Flexbox** (or **Grid**) for a clean, maintainable, and dynamic layout.
* **Breakpoints:** The layout transitions smoothly:
    * **Mobile:** Content stacks vertically.
    * **Tablet/Desktop:** The avatar is positioned to the left, with text and details to the right for a standard profile presentation.

### Behavior (JavaScript)

* The `test-user-time` element is dynamically updated using JavaScript to reflect the precise `Date.now()` value in milliseconds. The value updates periodically to maintain accuracy.
* Social links use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
